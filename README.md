# python_electron_template

A very simple starter project for running Python from an Electron App.

The example app only runs the Python script `hello.py` and prints the result 
in the console.

(Can be installed with `npm install -g typescript`)

- Install NPM packages => `npm install`
- Transpile and copy app to dist => `npm run build`
